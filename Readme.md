# LaTeX template for PSI slide presentations

## Usage restriction

Only for internal use by PSI employees for scientific presentations that require a lot of mathematics and cannot be done with the offical powerpoint template.


## New version (June 2024): Updated to new CI of PSI

### Usage

Copy all the files to Overleaf, or to your local TeX installation (who is still using this?).

Currently, as can be seen from the picture-files (.png), the cloud version is the blue one, and the "EES center" text is used. If you use another center, or another cloud color, just copy the pictures from the Master-slide from Powerpoint to .png files, and adapt the filenames in the preamble of the LaTeX file.

If you use Overleaf, you currently still need the Atmos-font (which is provided in the Atmos-folder). 

Note that because of the use of the non-LaTeX font, you have to choose as compile engine "LuaTeX" or "XeTeX" instead of the usual "pdfTeX".
