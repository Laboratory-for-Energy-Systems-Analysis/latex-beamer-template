# LaTeX template for PSI slide presentations

## Usage restriction

Only for internal use by PSI employees for scientific presentations that require a lot of mathematics and cannot be done with the offical powerpoint template.


## Updated to new CI of PSI

Currently, as can be seen from the picture-files (.png), the blue cloud version, and the EES center text is used. If you use another center, or another cloud, just copy the from the Master-slide from Powerpoint to .png files, and change the filenames in the preamble of the LaTeX file.

If you use Overleaf, you currently still need the Atmos-font (which is provided in the Atmos-folder). 

Note that because of this non-LaTeX font, you have choose as compile engine LuaTeX or XeTeX instead of the usual pdfTeX.
